# Introduction
Welcome! This program allows users to practice for the infamous "Mad Minutes", famous for making the best of students at Sharon High School sweat. Students are given three minutes to solve 15 trigonometry questions, and the quiz is graded on accuracy. Furthermore, after the first five quizzes, the time to solve is cut down to two minutes.
To help students prepare for this quiz, I created this program and repository to allow them to practice using the exact same questions as the ones on the actual quiz. This repository will be updated with more questions as teachers cover them at Sharon High School.

# Upcoming Features
